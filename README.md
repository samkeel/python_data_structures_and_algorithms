# Python Data Structures and Algorithms

Python is a powerful object-oriented language suitable for a wide array of tasks. Incorporated into the language are many useful data structures and algorithms, which are the building blocks from which complex software is built.

This repo is prepared from working through the book 'Python Data Structures and Algorithms' by Benjamin Baka. I am working through this to improve my knowledge and understanding of these fundamental concepts which will in turn improve my software and web apps.
